# Recession Yes/No


## Goal
- This project aims to create a Machine Learning model to predict whether the United States is in a recession.

## Project Descriptions
- What is the recession? The Economist published a recent article stating, "Recession is contested...Wikipedia editors cannot agree on the definition of 'recession'. Last month the site barred new and unregistered users from editing its page on the subject after a fierce dispute over the claim that two consecutive quarters of falling GDP indicates a recession". I believe this definition is misleading.[^1]
- The overall project will examine three different methods, numerically, to define what the recession is.
- Currently, "it typically takes the National Bureau of Economic Research about a year to decide on a recession call, though some decision have been made in a few months while others have taken almost twice as long." The machine learning model can be created from the best numerical method to predict the next recession and ultimately hope this can shorten the process.[^2]
- However, this machine learning model is not meant to challenge the Markov-switching dynamic regression model, which gives a recession probability to the current market. The classification model this project will create is for identifying whether the next estimated numerical data can put the United States into recession.

## Background
- After World War II, the price control during the catastrophic event was lifted; there was excessive money saved after years of war. Soon after the lifting of control, a more than 20% inflation at its peak happened. The end of WWII brought a new economic downturn to the nation. In 2020, the global pandemic created a traumatic event for the whole world, people lost their jobs, and the unemployment rate jumped from 3.6% to 13.0%. The federal reserve took some emergency procedures, including reducing the interest rate to almost 0% and loose [monetary policies](#term-defination); similarly, people saved execcsive amounts of money during the pandemic. In 2022, the ending of the pandemic era brought in similar spending alike in 1946. The current interest rate is 8.26%. It concerns the United States' long-term economic health.




## Term Defination
- Monetary Policy: Monetary policy is the actions that a nation's central bank takes to control the money supply in an economy with the goal of helping grow a slowing economy or to contract an economy that is growing too fast.
